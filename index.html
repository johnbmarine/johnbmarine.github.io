      <p>Hello, everyone! My name is John Marine, and I would like to welcome you to my page! This is a static site that will be updated regularly with content. Most of what you will see here is all original content. Since I don't get much feedback for my work, I haven't allowed comments to be posted. </p>
      <p> Here is a brief overview of me and what I provide to the online realm... </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>My Creative Profile at a Glance</h1>
      <h2>I am a Blogger!</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I have been blogging since circa 2005 on Myspace, blogged on Google's Blogger/Blogspot platform since 2009.</li>
        <li>I have made and maintained five different blogs in my time on Blogger/Blogspot. It was six, but one of them I retired long ago.</li>
        <li>I have allowed Guest Posts to be made from time to time. I even have done paid posts before.</li>
        <li>I had my own Wordpress site; but because of not being able to financially support it, the site only lasted just one or two years. So now I am looking to Github for a personal page.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>I am a Content Creator!</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Most of my creative work is done through my creative handle, "JohnMarineDesigns," which was the name of my Cafepress store many moons ago.</li>
        <li>I have made digital art. I am also learning to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) for art rather than shun it off completely. All of my own work is still original, though.</li>
        <li>I have done 3D modeling, including voxel models and proper 3D models.</li>
        <li>I have made music.</li>
        <li>I have made online videos since 2008.</li>
        <li>I have been an e-Book author.</li>
        <li>I developed assets for games and game projects.</li>
        <li>Since about 2021, I have developed a love of cooking. Most of which, done with air frying. I want to attempt using the Instant Pot one day. I fear burning down the kitchen with the stove/oven.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>My Philosophies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I tend to believe in quality over quantity. I tend to be minimalist often times, the "less is more" approach to life or making the most of not having the absolute best of things. So even if my work may not look top-notch, I still try to make the most out of so little.</li>
        <li>I tend to be frugal a lot of times. Sometimes even wondering how I can stretch my money or try to make the most with freely-available (sometimes subjective) material.</li>
        <li>I always want the best for people and want people to succeed in life. People shouldn't have to feel punished for not being at their best or not always being their best. I am happiest when I can make others happy and that I do not disappoint them.</li>
        <li>I have an abhorrence (outright hate) of negativity and negative thinking. I try to be as positive and hopeful as possible about many things in life. I also tend to not associate myself with entities that consistently or constantly spew negativity or negative vibes. What I want to try to do is generate positive energy to as many people as possible, and I feel dabbling with creative content makes this possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>

                <p>My "mother blog" since January 2009, "John's Blog Space" is about two things- anything and everything. Anything that crosses my mind, and everything that crosses my mind. My main blog has helped me to meet many people from around the world as it amassed over 3M blog view hits all-time (as of May 2023). This is no niche blog at all. However, topics from JBS have shown up in my other blogs and have been edited substantially. Care to take a visit? If so, click on the header to this description! </p>

                <p>"Life happens." That is the mantra to this blog that I dedicated in loving memory of my late grandmother. All of my blog posts in this blog relate to various life issues. I mention a variety of life issues ranging from light material to serious issues. If it affects your life in any such way, it will be mentioned here. I can not solve your life issues, but I can at least bring a number of these issues to light and offer commentary. It is the least I can do on my life issues blog.</p>
