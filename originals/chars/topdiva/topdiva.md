# Top Diva Series
Top Diva tells the story of several women who all come together to compete in an all-female fighting tournament.  Think of it primarily like the Street Fighter&copy; series.  This concept of mine dates back to 2008.

## STORY:
In an effort to boost tourism to Diva State, a former mixed-martial arts star launched a reality TV series to invite women from around the world to battle among themselves to become Grand Champion.

Females 18 and older competed to try to be the best in the world.  Multiple tournaments would happen through the history of this tournament.

In the first tournament, eight talented women became the first finalists of this tournament.  Eight out of many entrants qualified as finalists.  While a great majority of participants challenged, most simply went back home to tell their friends and family of their experience.  One group of women, however, felt they were rejected unfairly.  One such individual recruited certain dejected non-finalists in an attempt to sabotage the tournament and take over Diva State through factions.

The winner of the fighting tournament will have to fight for more than just a championship for a reality TV tournament.
