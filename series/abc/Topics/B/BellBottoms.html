bottoms
                are jeans and pants with massively flared legs. They have
                been iconic as counterculture especially in the times of
                Woodstock in
                the 1960s with hippies. They enjoyed further style in the 1970s
                and
                were just as iconic then as they were during the late 1960s.
                Today,
                bell bottom jeans and pants are still stylish, and many would
                wear
                these massively-flared jeans and pants than wear skinny jeans
                and
                skinny pants. The silhouette of bell bottoms allow for the
                illusion
                of longer legs. Bohemian and vintage types often pair bell
                bottoms
                with bell sleeve tops or Bohemian style peasant tops. Some go
                with
                either flat footwear or some sort of platform footwear to
                compliment
                bell bottoms. While bell bottoms have been worn by males and
                females, bell bottoms in this day and age are mostly worn by
                females.</span></span></span></font></font></p>

bottoms
                will NEVER go out of style regardless of what skinny jean and
                skinny pant types daresay. The funky, groovy appeal of bell
                bottoms
                are wonderful.</span></span></span></font>&nbsp; What may be a
        problem, however, are fashionable types of different heights wearing
        bell bottoms. For example, a petite female may seem swallowed up
        proportionally by wearing bell bottoms. Some petites even find a pair of
        cropped bell bottoms to better suit their petite frames.</span></p>
    <p class="western" style="line-height: 115%"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Regardless
        of whether you fancy modest bells or massive bells,feel free to rock
        this style as best as you can.&nbsp; It is not going away any time soon
        no matter what skinny bottoms types daresay.</span></p>
