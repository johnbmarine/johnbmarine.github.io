			Rather than clean or classic denim, denim washed in acid provides a tough looking pair of denim.

			I do not like acid-wash denim much at all.  I have not seen an actual pair of acid-wash denim that I like, nor would I recommend any acid-wash denim to any wardrobe.  It just looks tacky to me and not all that stylish in any sense.
