# My Blogging Work 
Besides my own unique content, I am also a blogger.  Because stars and space inspire me, each blog has a theme of space to it.  So let me introduce you to my blogging work.  If you are on social media, the included hashtags are to the right of each blog title so you can discuss it on social media or find all of my published work.  Click on each heading to visit that specific blog.

## [John's Blog Space](https://johnbmarine.blogspot.com) - #JohnsBlogSpace
My "mother blog" since January 2009, "John's Blog Space" is about two things- anything and everything.  Anything that crosses my mind, and everything that crosses my mind.  My main blog has helped me to meet many people from around the world as it amassed over 3M blog view hits all-time (as of May 2023).  This is no niche blog at all.  However, topics from JBS have shown up in my other blogs and have been edited substantially.  Care to take a visit?  If so, click on the header to this description!

## [John's Creative Space](https://johnscreativespace.blogspot.com) - #JohnsCreativeSpace
"John's Creative Space" showcases my own personal creative works.  It also includes insight on a lot of the material I've created as well as general discussions on creativity.

## [John's Race Space](https://johnsgtspace.blogspot.com) - #JohnsRaceSpace
Formerly "John's Gran Turismo Space," "John's Race Space" is a discussion of all things racing games and driving games.  If you can race in it, I'll probably discuss it on JRS.  The blog's namesake indicates the blog was originally about the Gran Turismo&copy; series and Tourist Trophy&copy;.

## [StyleSpace, by John B. Marine](https://stylespacebyjbm.blogspot.com) - #SSbyJBM
My fashion/beauty blog is StyleSpace.  Because the name was originally taken by another blogger, I tried to stand out by using the same name while offering my name to my blog on fashion/beauty.  Anything and everything fashion is featured here.  Each post has some sort of fashion or beauty connection.  So if this is what you love, please have a visit to my fashion/beauty blog!

## [John's Life Space](Https://johnslifespace.blogspot.com) - #JohnsLifeSpace
"Life happens."  That is the mantra to this blog that I dedicated in loving memory of my late grandmother.  All of my blog posts in this blog relate to various life issues.  I mention a variety of life issues ranging from light material to serious issues.  If it affects your life in any such way, it will be mentioned here.  I can not solve your life issues, but I can at least bring a number of these issues to light and offer commentary.  It is the least I can do on my life issues blog.



# My Other Works and Sites
I am on various places on social media.  As long as you are not someone of a scam or spam nature, I would love to meet new people.  So let's connect!
