  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Being named Buttercup Daisy Bonnet means one must love flowers.  And actually, she does.  Buttercup did not make the finalist crew for the first season of Top Diva.  However, she plays an important role in how the story of Story 1 is played out.</p>

  <h2>Personality</h2>  
  <p>Buttercup can be rather shy a person, but she is not shy about trying to expose a plot regarding the tournament.  She failed to become one of the eight finalists of the tournament.  Buttercup has utter disdain for one non-finalist named Carmel Henderson.  She plays as a decoy or a sting operator to pretend being one of the Jealous Girls or any of the factions trying to tear apart Diva State.  Her clear goal is to try to inform the finalists that they are targets to Carmel and her many henchwomen.</p>

  <h2>Friendships and Rivalries</h2>
  <p>Buttercup has healthy dislike for Carmel Henderson, and she would love to defeat Carmel any chance she gets.</p>
  
  <h2>Fashion</h2>
  <p>Buttercup has a fondness for high-waist style.  To that end, her outfit primarly consists of a button-down shirt and some high-waist bottoms.  She has some variations of the look to get some diversity going.</p>
  
  <p><b>OUTFIT 1:</b></br>
  Buttercup's main outfit is a dark green button-down blouse opened up.  That shirt is tucked into buttercup yellow high-waist dress pants, and she wears some platform lace-up boots.  The look is classy and a bit seductive.</p>

  <p><b>OUTFIT 2:</b></br> 
  Her alternative style consists of a plaid button-down shirt, but instead paired with high-waist jeans rather than high-waist dress pants.</p>
