  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>The only Top Diva finalist who is both married and a mother is 28-year old Lydia-Odelia Vasquez-Escobar.  Lydia was once unhappy with her weight and size.  Once she married her husband, Lydia began to lose lots of weight.  Lydia's husband plays on the Brazilian national soccer team.  Together, Lydia and her husband gave birth to their baby girl, Maria.  She tries to stay fit as much as she can.  She loves her sculpted chest and her strong arms and hands.</p>

  <h2>Personality</h2>  
  <p>Lydia comes under fire to many people because of her personality.  She has explosive anger and can be very anti-social and very unapproachable.  She can also be very arrogant.  A lot of her anger and disdain stems from her thinking Lydia is only famous for her famous soccer-playing husband, and she also feels that some males are trying to get with her even though she's married.  Lydia has been known to either engage in fiery anger and even physically attack other women whom she thinks are trying to flirt with her husband.  Lydia is also known to dabble in sarcasm and hateful words.  She also often takes on a serious mindset.  Rarely does she play around.  Simply put... this is not the kind of woman you would want to communicate with.</p>
  
  <h2>Fashion</h2>
  <p>Lydia has an athletic build.  To keep up her sporty style, she wears mostly active outfits.  She does have a few casual outfits.</p>
  
  <p><b>OUTFIT 1:</b></br>
  Her primary outfit consists of a sports bra, track pants, and active sneakers.  Her outfit mimics colors of the Brazilian flag.  The sports bra is green, the pants are yellow with blue stripes, and her sneakers are pure white.</p>
  <p><b>OUTFIT 2:</b></br> 
  Her secondary outfit is similar to her primary outfit, except instead of track pants, she wears an active skort.</p>
  <p><b>OUTFIT 3:</b></br>
  Her third outfit is fairly basic.  She wears a black camisole, some slim blue jeans, and some low-heel thong sandals.</p>
  <p><b>OUTFIT 4:</b></br>
  Lydia wears a black sundress with the same low-heel thong sandals.</p>
  
  <h2>Fighting</h2>
  <p>Lydia is an offensive powerhouse.  Though her primary offense consists of boxing punches, she also incorporates some kicking offense.  Just not enough to be a two-way threat, though.  Some say her weakness is when she taunts.  Lydia could leave herself wide open for an attacking barrage if Lydia gets too arrogant.</p>

<p><b>Rivalry:</b></p>
  <p>With almost everyone hating her, Lydia does not have any real rivals.  Some say the best match between her and any other Top Diva would be Marisol.  Marisol is a pure brawler that is as much as capable as Lydia.  But again- there is no outright rival of Lydia's.</p>

  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <p>* The fighting style I had in mind for Lydia is based on Vanessa of the Virtua Fighter series.</p>

  <p>Punishment is what Lydia is all about.  If you want</p>
