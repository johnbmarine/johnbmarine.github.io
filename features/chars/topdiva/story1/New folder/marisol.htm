  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Twenty-three year old Marisol Castillo believes life is one big party, and she's always the woman of the hour.  She is from the party hot spot and travel destination of Ibiza.  She is very much a fan of electronic dance music of many kinds.</p>

You will not see her being very drunk or high.  She also tries to maintain her fit figure.</p>
  
  <p>Like Candy Watanabe, Marisol loves 1970s style.  Marisol is a lot more casual than Candy and not as flamboyant as her.  People have tried to manufacture a rivalry between Marisol and Candy.  However, Marisol has healthy respect for Candy.  Since Marisol been wearing bell bottoms before Candy found her dream pair of bell bottoms, some call Marisol as "the original bell bottom girl."  All in all, Marisol fails to understand why people try to develop a rivalry that simply does not exist and simply does not have enough fire to fuel a proper rivalry.</p>
