  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Enter the world of Sandy _ Gonzales.  She is the lead guitarist and singer of an all-female rock group.  Music has always seemed to be a part of her life.  Music even SAVED her life.</p>

  <h2>Personality</h2>  
  <p>Sandy was once a pretty girl before a total transformation.  In her collegiate life, she was a promising pop star.  She competed to earn a recording artist deal with a prominent music producer.  However, her dreams were dashed when someone less talented than her won that contract.  The pain of not getting that contract left her life in shambles.  Sandy faced depression and gained a lot of weight.  She almost committed suicide.  As she was trying to rearrange her life, Sandy adopted a totally different lifestyle.  She shaved all of her pretty hair and even got some ear piercings.  Sandy also took up a hobby of backyard wrestling to stay fit.  Some girls who became fond of Sandy's music wanted to form a rock band.  Thereafter, Sandy started her own rock band.  They toured across many parts of Southern California and gained a great following.  Music has essentially saved her life.  As her popularity grew, Sandy started her own boutique catering to fans of rock music called Sandy's House of Rock (SHOR).</p>
  
  <p>Sandy is very casual as a person.  From time to time, she can be funny and sarcastic.  However, she never really hates anyone unless someone really bothers her.  She otherwise is selective in choosing her friends.</p>
  
  <h2>Fashion</h2>
  <p>In her transformation from pretty to rock, Sandy also started dressing less girly.  She trades girly style for more of a punk edge.</p>
  
  <p><b>OUTFIT 1:</b></br>
  Sandy's main outfit is a dark blue T-shirt, some dark gray cargo shorts extending above her knees, and a pair of black lace-up combat boots.</p>
  <p><b>OUTFIT 2:</b></br> 
  Sandy's alternate outfit consists of a T-shirt, some short overalls, and some canvas sneakers.</p>

  <h2>Fighting</h2>
  <p>Sandy's experience with backyard wrestling has given her the strength to become a powerful fighter.  In fact, she delivers powerful attacks and even some powerful throws.  She embodies the classic power fighter.  Because of this, Sandy may struggle against more athletic and quicker fighters.  As a buffer, though, she relies on her great stamina and powerful attacks to get her through matches.  She is the heaviest of the Top Diva fighters.</p>

<p><b>Rivalry:</b></p>
  <p>Sandy's primary rival is Keisha "Crazy Legs" Kirkpatrick.  As someone who strongly dislikes hip-hop music, it's natural she is incredibly jealous of Keisha for her music tastes and her style.  There is somewhat of a rivalry between herself and A.J. Garcia, but there is not any serious levels of hate for it to be a true rivalry.</p>

  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <p>* I had a tough time remembering her last name.  I stuck with Sandy Gonzales, but she was also known as Sandy Gutierrez.</p>

  <p>Sandy rocks!  Let her be your rockstar on the fighting front!</p>
