  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Nineteen-year old Suzanne Elise LeMarie is a college student.  She moved to the United States from her native France to study fashion design.  Her goal is to one day become a world-class fashion designer.</p>

  <h2>Personality</h2>  
  <p>Suzie is a person who can be shy at times.  However, she always tends to find reasons to smile.  She can be an introvert in regards to her feelings.  Never does she try to make outbursts or shun people out of her life.  What she considers as her strongest personality suit is to give to charity.  In fact, a famous fashion designer has semi-endorsed Suzie to do well.  Being the pay-it-forward type, she is willing to donate any money raised to any number of viable charities.</p>
  
  <p>Suzie has unfortunately fallen on hard times.  The death of Suzie's grandmother has left her in a state of depression.  Her depression makes it difficult to fully concentrate on a lot of things in her life.  She has even went as far as to see help from psychologists.  One of her long-time friends, Rumeur, has turned on her, possibly jealous of Suzie becoming a finalist of the Top Diva tournament.</p>
  
  <h2>Fashion</h2>
  <p>Suzie is from Paris and loves fashion.  Obviously, she has a sense of style.  Most of her outfits are more on the preppy side.  So rather than something seriously casual, she tends to find preppy outfits rather than anything seriously casual.  Suzie finds her backside and legs to be her favorite assets.</p>
  
  <p><b>OUTFIT 1:</b></br>
  In true Parisienne fashion, Suzie wears a beret cap.  Her beret is a bold red.  She also wears a button-down shirt, wool short shorts, and wedge ankle boots.  Alternatively, she wears colored tights.</p>
  <p><b>OUTFIT 2:</b></br>

  <h2>Fighting</h2>
  <p>Of all of the Top Diva fighters, Suzie is the only one actually trained in specific martial arts.  She has trained mostly in karate and has even tried some Tae Kwon Do.  The scouting report on Suzie says she lacks outright power.  However, she has speed and precision to deliver swift attacks and powerful throws.  Her method of fighting is more methodical rather than with brute strength.</p>
