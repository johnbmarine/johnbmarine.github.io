  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Candy Constance Watanabe is a go-go dancer.  She earned her fighting credentials by taking part in go-go dancer fights.  Candy and her go-go dancing team, the "Sweet Eats" have been wildly popular online.  It was enough to warrant Candy to be a finalist of the "Top Diva" fighting tournament.</p>
  
  <p>Candy has an upbringing that even she can't believe.  Simply put... Candy was born on Valentine's Day as her mother, Carol, had to have an emergency pregnancy at a candy store in a mall in Houston, Texas, USA.  Her life has circled mostly around performing and even in gymnastics.  Her fondest memory in gymnastics was in twirling a gorgeous gymnastic ribbon that had sequins on the ribbon part.  It felt she was twirling stars.  When Candy became a college student, she slowly had the interest to be a go-go dancer.  She somehow never had interest in being a cheerleader either in grade school or college.  As Candy started becoming more athletic, she started becoming confident in herself that she decided to wear some stylish go-go dancing outfits while also dancing on go-go platforms.  It was here where she met the "Sweet Eats" go-go dance team.  The team consists of "Honey" Heather, "Sugar" Suzanne, and "Cocoa" Cherise.</p>

  <h2>Personality</h2>  
  <p>Candy will tell you that live is meant to be lived.  So while she may not be totally adventurous, Candy is often not afraid to try something outside of her comfort zone.  Candy has a fun and friendly personality.  She also has a bit of a sassy style to her.  However, she is not a drama queen or tries to be the center of attention all the time.  She often enjoys most puns regarding candy and sweets.  Even Candy herself likes to think of herself as being sweet as candy.  The kind of candy that Candy often prefers is sweet chocolate.  Despite her Japanese surname, Candy is not adept at Japanese and rarely practices speaking Japanese.</p>
  
  <p>While Candy can be fun, she has a dark side if she is pushed too far.  Candy doesn't react with outrage and anger, but she often responds with sarcasm.  She basically masks her anger by providing underhanded insults.  Some say this condescending trait about her makes Candy dangerous.  She otherwise tries not to enter any kind of rage.</p>
  
  <h2>Fashion</h2>
  <p>Candy loves vintage-type fashion, especially of the 1970s and even some 1990s trends.  For the longest, she has always wanted to find a pair of bell bottom jeans or pants she can enjoy wearing.  It wasn't until she went to a thrift shop in Diva County where she found a pair of white bell bottom jeans with massive flares to them.  This sort of motivated Candy to design her own custom/bespoke bell bottoms.  So she even tried to take a pair of white active leggings and turn them into wide-flare bell bottoms.  The same day she bought those stylish bell bottom jeans, Candy also found a big, adorable straw floppy hat that had peppermint stripes on it.  This further extended the candy theme that so defines her style.</p>
  
  <p><b>OUTFIT 1:</b></br>
  Candy's primary outfit consists of a cropped sleeveless top, high-waist bell bottom pants with massive flares, and a pair of platform wedge peep-toe mary jane pumps.  Flirty appeal is added since these huge shoes hide underneath Candy's bell bottoms.</p>
  <p><b>OUTFIT 2:</b></br> 
  Candy has a "sailor" outfit that consists of a sailor hat, a nautical-style cropped camisole, sailor button high-waist flared pants, and a pair of platform peep-toe pumps.</p>
  <p><b>OUTFIT 3:</b></br>
  Candy's go-go dancing outfit consists of a bikini top, a skort (shorts hiding underneath a skirt or with skirt-like panels), and a huge pair of platform wedge patchwork boots.</p>
  <p><b>OUTFIT 4:</b></br>
  To be casual, Candy wears a polo shirt, twill short shorts, and a pair of boat shoes.</p>
  
  <h2>Fighting</h2>
  <p>Candy has proven herself to be a strong competitor in the viral videos of her go-go team.  Some say her big shoes make it tough for her to be a totally superior fighter.  She says her big shoes actually feel airy and rarely feels any kind of discomfort.  However, Candy welcomes this challenge and honestly does not mind having this disadvantage.  It makes her rely more on basic offense instead of try to be a speed demon of some kind.</p>

<p><b>Rivalry:</b></p>
  <p>Candy's best friend is Abigail.  Their friendship, however, leads to a convenient rivalry.  There is a rivalry between her and Marisol, but this is more manufactured a rivalry than any outright hate.  Though Candy is not fully Japanese, some even consider her and Tomomi as rivals, in regards to Japanese descent fighters.</p>
  
  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <p>* Candy Watanabe was originally named Candy Love, but I wanted to change up that name since it felt taken.</p>
  <p>* Believe it or not, Candy was supposed to have blonde hair and blue eyes!  I wanted to make her more "American" than Japanese.</p>
  </br></br></br></br></br></br>
  
  <p>Candy is pretty sweet, for more reasons than one.</p>
