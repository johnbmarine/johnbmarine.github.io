  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Keisha Kirkpatrick is a 20-year old dancer and recording artist.  Hailing from Atlanta, Georgia, USA; she is very much indulged in the lore of hip-hop talent in Atlanta.  She briefly moved to Birmingham, Alabama, USA to study choreography.  Keisha is best known as "Crazy Legs," and she primarily earned that because of her unique dance moves.  She also tries to incorporate her hip-hop dance style into fighting.</p>

  <h2>Personality</h2>  
  <p>Keisha is a very fun and intriguing person to be around.  She likes making people happy and making them laugh.  She has loved music all of her life.  Her tastes in music is really varied.  For example, she loves high-powered hip-hop music, but she also listens to breakbeat and even some other low-intensity electronic dance music.  While she mostly dabbles with hip-hop dance, she also can do certain raves.  So her tastes in music and dance are not entirely exclusive to hip-hop.</p>
  
  <p>Despite being proud of her accomplishments, Keisha will feel happiest if she can help her mother.  Keisha's mother is battling breast cancer, and Keisha wants to use her earnings to help finance her mother's breast cancer surgery.  Keisha's mother is a musical legend in her own right.  She has been one of the brightest stars of MoTown music during the glory days of rhythm and blues music.  Keisha would love to help her mother win against breast cancer.</p>
  
  <p>Keisha is not a confrontational person.  However, she has a rivalry with Sandy Gonzales.  Sandy hates Keisha's hip-hop and dancing style.  Likewise, Keisha rarely listens to any kind of rock music.  This has become more of a musical rivalry.</p>
  
  <h2>Fashion</h2>
  <p>The most important element of Keisha's style is in promoting breast cancer awareness.  So she proudly wears her cropped pink hoodie as her primary outfit.  Other outfits simply showcase her casual style.</p>
  
  <p><b>OUTFIT 1:</b></br>
  Keisha wears a pink cropped hoodie.  The cropped hoodie has a white ribbon on the back to keep Keisha's mother with her in spirit.  The rest of her outfit consists of a black sports bra, green cropped linen cargo pants, and white sneakers.</p>

  <h2>Fighting</h2>
  <p>Keisha incorporates her dancing-based style into her offense.  Her quickness and her athletic build makes her very capable.  Paramount to her offense is the use of her feet and legs.  She also has some solid punch attacks an a few throws for balance.  Trouble is, she may rely too much on her legs that she could easily get into trouble if confounded.</p>

<p><b>Rivalry:</b></p>
  <p>Keisha's primary rival is Sandy Gonzales.  Sandy is not a hip-hop music fan, so it is natural she dislikes Keisha.  Keisha is usually non-confrontational.  In fact, Keisha feels she is unnecessarily a rival of Sandy.  Either way, the two are somehow rivals.  Even though the two are strong rivals, Sandy is at least kind enough and caring enough to understand Keisha wanting to fight to save her mother's life.  Sandy wishes Keisha's mother can overcome breast cancer.  The hate between these two is only among these two and not among other family members and/or friends.</p>
  
  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <p>* Some of Keisha's offense is inspired by breakbeat, hip-hop dance, and even capoeira.</p>
