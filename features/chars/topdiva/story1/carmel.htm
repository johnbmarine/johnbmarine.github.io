  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Carmel is the villain of Top Diva.  She is trying to sabotage the first-ever all-female fighting tournament held in Diva State.</p>

  <h2>Personality</h2>  
  <p>Carmel Henderson was among many women trying to become part of the field of finalists for the first-ever all-female fighting tournament.  When she failed to qualify, she was bitterly disappointed.  Carmel felt a number of women were more talented than the finalists.  So rather than try again in a future tournament, she decided to enlist a number of factions to try to take over Diva State.  Collectively, these girls were known as the "Jealous Girls" to many people.</p>
  
  <h2>Fashion</h2>
  <p>Carmel decided to dress up for a night out.  This makes up her primary outfit.  She paired her party dress with some fierce gladiator sandals.</p>

  <h2>Fighting</h2>
  <p>Carmel is more petty than a talented fighter.  Her method of getting in peoples' heads is to do things most people would consider disgraceful or classless.  In fact, she even enlisted "Jealous Girls" to provide melee attacks to protect her.</p>

  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <p>* Carmel is one of only two natural blondes in Story 1.</p>

  <p>* The color combination of blue and gold coincides with my favorite color combination.</p>

  <p>* As she was meant to be part of a project for the PC fighting game engine "M.U.G.E.N.," her "boss" palette is palette 12.  Palette 12 is often the most powerful or most unique version of most MUGEN characters.</p>
