  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Tomomi Tsuchiya is the youngest of the Top Diva finalists.  She is also the shortest at exactly five feet tall.  Her passions are sports and animals.  She moved to America to play softball.  She also moved to Columbus, Ohio, USA for college.  The move then came to Diva County after becoming a Top Diva finalist.</p>

  <h2>Personality</h2>  
  <p>Tomomi enjoys sports and also loves animals.  While she is not any kind of animal rights activist, she does care deeply about animals.  She has a pet cat named Noriko.  Tomomi has an emotional attachment to Noriko because she is named after her best friend, Noriko, who was killed in a car crash.  Tomomi sometimes feels Noriko's cat has Noriko's soul and often encourages her to do well as an athlete and as a person.</p>
  
  <p>When word of the Top Diva tournament came along, she entered on her birthday.  The tournament requires contestants to be 18 years or older.  On the very first day of Top Diva trials, that was her birthday.  She impressed the judges to a great extent that she was invited to the Top Diva tournament.</p>

  <p>Tomomi's English is not very good.  However, she doesn't really need a translator to help communicate with others.</p>
  
  <h2>Fashion</h2>
  <p>Tomomi is about being sporty while also being casual.  She also often times carries her custom aluminum softball bat.  The softball pants, unlike the shorts, are white instead of tan.</p>
  
  <p><b>OUTFIT 1:</b></br>
  Tomomi wears as a primary outfit her blue softball jersey, tan-colored flap pocket short shorts, and a pair of school girl mary janes.</p>

  <p><b>OUTFIT 2:</b></br> 
  Tomomi's alternate outfit trades the short shorts for softball pants, and she also trades her mary janes for softball cleats.</p>

  <p><b>OUTFIT 3:</b></br>
  Tomomi wears an active tank top, active leggings, and some active sneakers as another outfit.</p>

  <p><b>OUTFIT 4:</b></br>
  Tomomi has a traditional Japanese folk outfit considering of a kimono, hakama pants, and geta sandals.</p>
  
  <h2>Fighting</h2>
  <p>Tomomi is short.  To give herself a reach advantage, she carries and uses her softball bat.  However, she only really uses it for some Super-style attacks.  Some say the softball bat gives her an unnecessary advantage.  This is more compensation than anything.  She is no doubt very quick.  On the other hand, she lacks power in her attacks and is not very good at taking beatings.  This means Tomomi has to put away her opponents early even despite the fact Tomomi is so sporty.  Some say Tomomi should put on more weight, but she is still the lighest of the Top Diva contenders.</p>

<p><b>Rivalry:</b></p>
  <p>Tomomi has no real rivals.  Some try to consider Tomomi and Candy as rivals, since both have Japanese in their blood.  However, Tomomi and Candy get along very well despite the language barrier.  Some even consider Tomomi and Suzie as rivals since both are still teenagers.</p>
