        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Coming from a major city, one young lady knows the importance of
          standing out among others. Enter one Abigail Jessica Garcia. She is
          commonly referred to as "Abbie" or "AJ." AJ describes herself as an
          absolute girly-girl. AJ does not let the fact she is from a major city
          alter her personality or train of thought. Even AJ understands her
          limits. She is a college student of St. John's University in New York
          City studying Mass Communications. Both of her parents are United
          States citizens from their native El Salvador. Abbie celebrates her
          Salvadoran heritage as well as her American heritage.</p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>As far as being a person goes, Abigail is one of the sweetest and
          most humble persons one will ever meet. She was well taught by her
          Salvadoran parents to be humble and kind. She smiles often, as if her
          smile is surgically attached to her face. She can not stand being
          around mean or sarcastic people. Abbie's passion to make herself and
          others smile is important to her, as she feels this world can be so
          cruel and in need of some sort of positive reinforcement.</p>
        <p>As far as being an "absolute girly-girl," Abigail loves almost
          everything most her age enjoy. She is an avid shopper and loves to
          have fun. AJ even enjoys cooking. Even this big city girl has a
          girl-next-door personality and never tries to be a drama queen.</p>
        <p>Abigail is also aware that she is not slim. In fact, AJ still
          considers herself beautiful even if she is not on the slim and slender
          side. There was a point in her High School life where she was not
          happy with her body appearance. While AJ was never obese, she does
          regularly try to maintain her weight. She does not consider herself
          chubby despite being at the high end of being petite.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Fashion</h2>
        <p>Abigail cares about fashion, but she is not into any trends or feel
          she has to dress like everyone else to be accepted. In other words,
          she does not care if her style is years behind the rest of the world.
          AJ simply wears what she feels most comfortable in. Some people feel a
          lot of her outfits seem too childish to wear for a 21-year old.</p>
        <p><b>OUTFIT 1:</b><br>
          Abigail's main outfit consists of a cropped denim jean bolero, a satin
          camisole, mid-calf length culotte pants, and a pair of canvas
          sneakers. The culotte pants are pleated and are skirt-like.</p>
        <p><b>OUTFIT 2:</b><br>
          Abigail wears an adorable outfit consisting of a cap-sleeve T-shirt, a
          dark gray sundress, black leggings, and black ballet flats.</p>
        <p><b>OUTFIT 3:</b><br>
          Being a bit daring, Abigail wears an outfit consisting of a cropped
          top, jeans cuffed at around mid-calf, and paired with some casual
          metallic sandals.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>OUTFIT 4:</b><br>
          For nights out, Abigail wears a satin kimono dress along with some
          metallic sandals.</p>
        <h2>Fighting</h2>
        <p>As a part of a fighting tournament, Abigail is seen as being overall
          average despite her heavy body set.</p>

        <h2>Friendships and Rivalries</h2>
        <p>Abigail is best friends with Candy Watanabe. The two got to enjoy
          being around each other during qualifying trials. She also developed
          friendships with the likes of Suzie St. Marie after being concerned
          about Suzie's mental health issues. Despite the healthy love for
          Candy, Candy is considered Abigail's primary rival.</p>
        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <p>* Abigail's color combination of pink/white/brown was semi-inspired
          by Neapolitan ice cream.</p>
        <p>* Because this character was one of my creations from around 2008,
          the culotte pants worn by Abigail are gaucho pants.</p>
