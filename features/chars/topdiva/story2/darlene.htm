  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>After years training to become the best lawyer in the state of Texas, Darlene Ivana Espinosa decided to become a fashion model.</p>

  <h2>Personality</h2>  
  <p>Darlene is a woman of class and elegance.  This is unusual for a woman in her late 20s.  Darlene is a lady who doesn't mind being wined and dined.  She expects you to shake her hand firmly if you do handshakes.  Darlene takes compliments, but she expects adults to act like adults towards her... even including young college students.  Darlene isn't overly antisocial or any kind of drama queen, though.  She also isn't a hyprocrite or gets under anyone's skin.</p>

  <p>Darlene will jokingly tell you that she only look crazy.</p>
  
  <h2>Fashion</h2>
  <p>Her primary outfit is a blouse, some pants, and some red high-heel shoes.  For fighting sake, she trades her high heels for ballet flats.  Sort of her trademark is having long hair cover her right side of her face.  She also wears red lipstick.</p>
  
  <p><b>OUTFIT 1:</b></br>
  Darlene wears a short-sleeve white blouse, some black dress pants, and red ballet flats as her main fighting outfit.</p>
  <p><b>OUTFIT 2:</b></br> 
  Darlene's second outfit is the same as the first outfit.  However, instead of pants, she wears a knee-length dress skirt.</p>
  <p><b>OUTFIT 3:</b></br>
  Her fancy outfit is an elegant shift dress paired with some high-heel pumps.</p>

  <h2>Fighting</h2>
  <p>Darlene can be nonchalant in her fighting.  Her offense consists of mostly martial arts style moves and grapples.</p>
