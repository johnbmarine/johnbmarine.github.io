    <h1> Track Introduction </h1>
    <p> Colorado Road is a Grand Prix-type race track that is very long.
      Situated somewhere southwest of Denver, Colorado, USA; this track utilizes
      a lot of natural terrain. It also has recently been involved in more
      eco-friendly practices. Windmills power parts of the circuit outside of
      its base power source. This course has a lot of speedy sections but also a
      lot of elevation changes and technical corners. This course will challenge
      drivers of different levels ranging from amateur to professionals. </p>
    <p> Three layouts are on offer for all who race at Colorado Road. No matter
      what configuration a driver uses or a race is held on, a number of
      challenges will await all drivers of all skill levels. The Junior layout
      can fun for those looking for some thrill in going up elevation changes.
      The National and Grand Prix Layouts will offer up the Colorado Carousel- a
      sweeping long right with banking on the inside and a quick kink that goes
      downhill upon exit. For those who challenge the Grand Prix course, prepare
      to experience some jumps going uphill. The Grand Prix course has a speedy
      uphill section, but one had better be ready to slow down hard once the
      Grand Prix course reaches its highest elevation point.</p>
    <p> The challenge and length of Colorado Road also lends itself to endurance
      racing possibilities. An amateur-level endurance can be utilized on the
      National course, and drivers ranging from high-end amateurs to world-class
      racing drivers can take on the full Grand Prix layout for an endurance.
      The National and Grand Prix layouts can suit up to 40 cars. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Junior Layout Discussion </h2>
    <p> The Junior Layout of Colorado Road utilizes the eastern end of the
      course. It is almost essentially a modified oval with six corners and a
      kink. It is meant to be for up to 20 cars. This track mostly suits
      low-powered to mid-powered sports cars. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>National Layout Discussion </h2>
    <p> The National Layout of the course uses the Grand Prix Circuit, but only
      the first third of the course. The first two corners are fairly sharp. The
      first elevation change leads to the Colorado Carousel. The uphill entry is
      fairly blind, so use proper judgment to determine the best line. It is
      also a good idea to avoid going too wide in this area. Once the Carousel
      is cleared, a quick drop in elevation change leads up to the next sharp
      corner. The course then goes downhill and to the left. Gentle corners make
      up the shorter course. Make sure your car is set up to take on the
      switchbacks that lead to the Start/Finish straight. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Grand Prix Layout Discussion </h2>
    <p> The ultimate challenge of Colorado Road is its Grand Prix course. While
      the other two layouts have one set of elevation changes, the Grand Prix
      layout has three. After the downhill of the National course, the Grand
      Prix course goes right. A straight follows into the Junior layout and the
      uphill trudge and jump. After clearing the Junior section, go straight
      ahead into the uphill section with two jumps.  Towards the slow chicane, it is mostly narrow to remind you to slow down considerably.  Clearing the chicane leads to a softer chicane that leads to a soft downhill section.  Going downhill completely leads to the pit road and the kink and corner leading to the Start-Finish line.  This layout is very long, so be ready to endure an intense racing challenge. </p>
