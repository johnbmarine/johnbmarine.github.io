    <p> Welcome! </p>
    <p> Start your engines- let's go racing! </p>
    <p> I am a motorsports enthusiast. When I had the opportunity to develop a
      race track for any given game or game engine, I jumped in on the
      opportunity to develop courses. What you will see here are my many
      different creations. </p>
    <p> Believe it or not, a lot of my earliest creations for race tracks were
      from non-racing games. So I was kind of like, "fake it until you make it."
      I still had fun with my work regardless. Now I am sharing my work with
      you. A hope of mine is to offer these for download or sale across a number
      of different platforms.</p>
